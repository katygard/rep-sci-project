Long-term sulfate x temperature rearing experiment using Pteronarcys californica.
Experiment duration: July 28 2020-Dec 28 2020
Authors: Katy Gardner, Chuck Hawkins 

This experiment is part of a series of long-term lab experiments, designed to better understand the effects of salinity and temperature on macroinvertebrate growth and survival, with special emphasis on specific ion concentrations.
