Data collected during these experiments include: survivorship data, growth data, water chemistry, and water quality measurements. Overall, these experiments are designed to investigate the effects of salinity and temperature on aquatic insect growth and survival. The data used in this project are from my first experiment, in which I exposed Pteronarcys californica nymphs (the giant salmonfly) to 6 sulfate concentration treatments across 6 temperature treatments, for a total of 36 exposure treatments. 1.1 Project Goals In this project, I will: clean and manage the data I have collected for this experiment create a database structure that can also be used in future experiments generate a fitness index visually inspect collected data for treatment effects on survival and fitness index 1.2 Project Outline Chapter 2 details the process of creating an RSQLite database in RMarkdown and importing all project data (mentioned above: survivorship, growth, water quality and water chemistry) into this database. Chapter 3 visually inspects the survival data for trends in % survival in response to either the sulfate or temperature treatments. Chapter 4 generates a fitness index using the survival and growth data from our database, and uses the fitness index data in plots to visualize the effects of temperature and sulfate treatments on Pteronarcys fitness.

The files pertain to two main entities: the tanks and the bugs. Tanks contain bugs in certain treatment conditions (temperature and added sulfate). There are 3 sampling processes going on: tanks, bugs, and chemical analyses. Chemical analyses are conducted prior to the start of the experiment and at the end of the experiment. Tanks are measured approximately twice a week (with some variability) for dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature levels as a sort of maintenance measurement. The number of bugs alive per tank is measured once a week and recorded as that tanks survival. Finally, bugs are measured once every two weeks for head capsule width, which can then be converted to a specific growth measurement. The database structure I intend to follow is displayed below. Figure 2.1: Database structure. Italics denote primary key, bold denotes foreign keys. 2.1 USUAL water data First, I will create a database connection in the project folder of my Reproducible Science class folder. #establish a database connection ptery_sulf_db &lt;- dbConnect(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;../raw_data/ptery_sulf.db&quot;) Next, I want to load in all of the .csv files I intend to add to the database. Ill start with USUAL water measurement data.

Not sure if empty/blank cells are more appropriate than 0&#39;s? We want to combine these two USUAL .csv files into one for the database. Some cleaning needs to be done before merging the two files. Additionally, carbonate and bicarbonate were only measured in the second round of tests (end), so these columns will need to be added to the first document.

However, survival is only one piece of the overall fitness puzzle were looking at. In the next section of this project, we will generate a fitness index combining the survival data and growth data to see how overall Pteronarcys fitness was affected by these treatements. "],["fitness.html", "Chapter 4 Fitness index 4.1 Generate fitness index 4.2 Data visualization", " Chapter 4 Fitness index We are ultimately interested in how overall organism fitness is impacted by sulfate levels. We can better visualize that through a fitness index that combines survival and growth measurements. The fitness index is calculated by multiplying percent survival by the average growth rate (G) for each treatment. 4.1 Generate fitness index To generate our fitness index, we first need to source the data were interested in from our database ptery_sulf_db (Chapter 2). We will be using data from the head_width and survival tables, but only grabbing data for bugs who survived until the end of the experiment (week 22). We will also be omitting the first week of measurement data in head_width due to issues with observer error. # only select head width information of individuals that were alive on 2nd measurement day and last hw_survivors &lt;- dbGetQuery(ptery_sulf_db, &quot;SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM head_width WHERE bug_id IN( SELECT bug_id FROM head_width GROUP BY bug_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT meas_id) = 12)) WHERE (week = 2) OR (week = 22);&quot;) #nested inquiry isolates individuals alive on all dates #WHERE statement selects only the data from last first and last measurement dates end_survival &lt;- dbGetQuery(ptery_sulf_db, &quot;SELECT * FROM survival WHERE date = &#39;2020-12-28&#39;;&quot;) sum(end_survival$survival) ## [1] 240 Output should read 240, which is the number of individuals alive in the last measurement date out of 360. Next, we will calculate the growth rate for each individual using the specific growth rate (G) equation. hw_survivors &lt;- hw_survivors[,c(2,5:7)] hw_survivors &lt;- spread(hw_survivors, week, head_width) hw_survivors &lt;- hw_survivors %&gt;% dplyr:: rename(init = 3, final = 4) %&gt;% mutate(ln = log(final/init), G = (ln/140)*100 ) #140 days between 08/10 and 12/28 #average growth rate for each tank tank_fit &lt;- aggregate(hw_survivors[,6], list(hw_survivors$tank), mean) tank_fit &lt;- tank_fit %&gt;% dplyr::rename(tank = Group.1, avg_G = x) To calculate the fitness index, we want survival to be represented as the proportion of individuals alive out of 10. #change survival numbers to proportions end_survival &lt;- end_survival %&gt;% mutate(surv_prop = survival/10) Finally, we will use the specific growth rate (G) data and the survival data to create our fitness index for each tank. #create fitness index tank_fit &lt;- tank_fit %&gt;% mutate(surv_prop = end_survival$surv_prop, fit_index = (surv_prop*avg_G), temp = end_survival$set_temp, trtment = end_survival$sulfate_trtment) ###NOTE: first, third, fourth line of mutate code only worked well bc tanks were in order in both df&#39;s ###would need to recode to include some &quot;by group&quot; argument to get to work otherwise 4.2 Data visualization 4.2.1 3D Surface plot prep &lt;- tank_fit[order(tank_fit$trtment),] #reordering survival.wide by sulfate level prep1 &lt;- prep[order(prep$temp),] #now reordering by temperature #you want the reordering steps so that you can predictably label the z matrix w/ temp and sulfate #column/row names. the original survival.wide had treatments in no particular order temp &lt;- seq(12, 22, 2) #setting up matrix colnames sulf &lt;- seq(0, 1000, 200) #rownames z &lt;- matrix(prep1$fit_index, 6, 6) #reformatting 36 survival data points into matrix, by treatment rownames(z) &lt;- sulf colnames(z) &lt;- temp surf_fit &lt;- plot_ly(type = &quot;surface&quot;, z=z, x=temp, y=sulf) surf_fit &lt;- surf_fit %&gt;% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = &#39;Temperature&#39;), yaxis = list(title = &#39;Sulfate mg/L&#39;), zaxis = list(title = &#39;Fitness Index&#39;))) surf_fit Not seeing a clear trend from the 3D surface plot, whether it be to temperature, sulfate, or an interaction of the two. (hint: it moves! drag it around to view from different angles) 4.2.2 Grouped bar plots Lets visualize the data by one treatment at a time (temperature first, then sulfate). The method we will use here still shows individual tanks and what their treatment level was of the other treatment, but we group bars by the primary treatment we are visualizing. tank_fit$temp &lt;- as.factor(tank_fit$temp) tank_fit$trtment &lt;- as.factor(tank_fit$trtment) #grouped by temp ggplot(tank_fit, aes(fill=trtment, y=fit_index, x=temp)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;, stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + scale_fill_viridis_d()+ labs(x = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;, y = &quot;Fitness Index&quot;, fill = &quot;Sulfate (mg/L)&quot;) + theme_bw() #grouped by sulfate treatment ggplot(tank_fit, aes(fill=temp, y=fit_index, x=trtment)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;, stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+ scale_fill_viridis_d()+ labs(x = &quot;Sulfate (mg/L)&quot;, y = &quot;Fitness Index&quot;, fill = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;) + theme_bw() Hmm again, no clear patterns. Perhaps this is because grouped bar plots like this are a bit messy. Lets average fitness index values across single treatments to simplify the plots. 4.2.3 Fitness index averaged bar plots #fitness index averaged by temp avg &lt;- tank_fit %&gt;% group_by(temp) %&gt;% summarise(fit_index = mean(fit_index)) ggplot(tank_fit, aes(x=temp, y=fit_index, color = temp, fill = temp)) + geom_point(aes(shape = trtment)) + geom_bar(data=avg, stat = &quot;identity&quot;, alpha = 0.7) + ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = tank), color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 2.5, segment.color = &quot;grey&quot;) + scale_color_viridis_d() + scale_fill_viridis_d() + labs(x = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;, y = &quot;Fitness Index&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) #fitness index averaged by sulfate treatment avg &lt;- tank_fit %&gt;% group_by(trtment) %&gt;% summarise(fit_index = mean(fit_index)) ggplot(tank_fit, aes(x=trtment, y=fit_index, color = trtment, fill = trtment)) + geom_point(aes(shape = temp)) + geom_bar(data=avg, stat = &quot;identity&quot;, alpha = 0.7) + ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = tank), color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 2.5, segment.color = &quot;grey&quot;) + scale_color_viridis_d() + scale_fill_viridis_d() + labs(x = &quot;Sulfate (mg/L)&quot;, y = &quot;Fitness Index&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) In the plots, the points represent individual tanks, while the bars represent the average fitness index of those tanks. There is almost a unimodal patterned response to temperature, but fitness is a bit higher in the highest temp. This is surprising, because other research from my lab has shown Pteronarcys californica has an optimal temperature of about 14-16, and really marginal to no survival at high temperatures like 22C. No clear trends in response to sulfate levels. "]]
